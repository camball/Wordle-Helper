# Wordle Helper

I promise it's not cheating :sob: (or maybe you might think it is... don't judge)

I justify myself using these scripts because it's the same process I do in my head... just if my head had a big dictionary with near-instantaneous lookup time...

## Description

This is the helper tool I coded to help me in the game of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## Dependencies

This project uses the [inflect](https://pypi.org/project/inflect/) library to not suggest plural words to the user (as WORDLE never uses plurals as the correct answer).
