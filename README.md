# Wordle Helper

## Installation

```

## How to Run

From the directory this repository was downloaded into, run:

```sh
python3 -m wordle
```

## Description

This is the helper tool I coded to help me in the game of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Hopefully you don't think this is cheating :joy::sob: (or maybe you might think it is... don't judge)

I justify myself using these scripts because it's the same process I do in my head... just if my head had a big dictionary with near-instantaneous lookup time, and I were a perfect logician...

## Dependencies

This project uses the [inflect](https://pypi.org/project/inflect/) library to not suggest plural words to the user (as WORDLE never uses plurals as the correct answer).
